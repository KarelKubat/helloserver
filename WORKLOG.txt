*** SETUP ***
- Have GOPATH pointed to pwd
    export GOPATH=$(pwd)
  Or be creative in ~/.bashrc and put the contents of 'setgopath.sh' in there.
- Test run locally:
    go run src/helloserver/helloserver.go
- Test install locally:
    go install helloserver
- Test the binary:
    bin/helloserver

*** BUILD AND TEST DOCKER ***
- Build docker image:
    docker build -t helloserver
- Test docker:
    docker run
      --publish 1234:8080 \       # docker's port 8080 is 1234 on the outside
      --name=helloserver-docker \ # some odd name
      --rm \                      # remove when done
      helloserver:v1              # image with tag as in Dockerfile
- For a daemon you would:
    docker stop helloserver:v1
